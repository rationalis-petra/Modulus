# The Modulus Programming Language

ðŸš§ðŸ”¨ **Under Construction**  ðŸª›ðŸš§

Modulus is a programming language which is currently under heavy development. As
such, it is rife with bugs, idiosyncrasies and unimplemented features. However,
you can still try it out if you're interested.

## Features

+ **Structures** are a mechanism for packaging type(s) and associated
  behaviour. They offer a compelling alternative to object systems for
  implementing dynamic behaviour. 

+ **Algebraic Effects** allow you to define things like exceptions, state,
  cooperative multithreading and more - all as libraries. As such, Modulus
  doesn't actually implement any of these features! (They are available in the
  standard library though). 

+ **Dependent Types** are a powerful generalisation of existing type-systems,
  enabling your types to express arbitrary properties, like "a function which
  returns only even numbers" or "a function which outputs strings containing
  only the letters a, b and c". 

+ **Metaprogramming** allow you to write code which writes code. You can write
  two types of macros, either modifying the parser, or rewriting syntax trees. 

<!-- + The **Interative Enviroment** is not a feature of the language itself, but of -->
<!--   this particular implementation. Break the compile-test-rewrite cycle by -->
<!--   swapping function definitions, watch variable values, and more - all live as -->
<!--   your code is running! -->


## Installation
There are currently no distributed binaries for modulus, so you must build from
source. The steps to do so are as follows

1. Install the [Haskell Tool Stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/),
   if you don't already have it
2. Clone this repo onto your local file
3. From inside this repository, run either
  + `stack build`,
  + `staack install` or
  + `stack run`. In order to provide command line args to the modulus program
    this way, you'll need to prefix `--`. So, to run modulus with the interpret
    (`-i`) flag, you do: `stack run -- -i`. To run modulus in interpreted mode
    on the file "myprog.mls", call `stack run -- -i --file myprog.mls`

Currently a WIP, sorry...
